            I am a dedicated full-stack developer passionate about creating innovative, cost-efficient solutions that deliver outstanding user experiences. With expertise in backend technologies like Node.js, Express, and Prisma, and frontend tools like React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, I thrive at bridging the gap between design and functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            When working on projects for clients or companies, I focus on building solutions that are not only efficient but also scalable and user-centric. As the lead backend developer for the Bookworm project, I successfully delivered an MVP in just two months, demonstrating my ability to manage complexity and deliver under tight deadlines.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I may lack in experience, I more than make up for with hard work, passion, and an unrelenting drive to succeed. I am constantly exploring new tools and technologies to expand my skill set and keep up with industry trends.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my downtime, I enjoy reading about emerging tech trends, experimenting with new frameworks, and contributing to open-source projects. Iâ€™m committed to growing as a developer and building solutions that make an impact.
